# memescript 1.0
Memescript 1.0 is an esoteric language based off of the "frick frack" meme and influenced by Brainf\*\*k (but it's not a Trivial Brainf\*\* Substitution!).

See the file `meme.md` for details on how to use it.

Every Memescript program does not start until `what the` is present in the source.
